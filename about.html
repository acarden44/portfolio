      <div class="row mb-5">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>
            I'm a Software QA Manager with over a decade of experience driving
            quality and innovation in fast-paced tech environments. I specialize
            in building scalable testing strategies, improving automation
            frameworks, and leading cross-functional teams that deliver
            high-impact, reliable products.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've developed a reputation for combining
            strong technical expertise with a deep commitment to leadership
            development and process improvement. I bring a hands-on approach to
            Quality Assurance, blending manual and automated testing practices,
            and I'm passionate about building collaborative workflows that
            bridge the gaps between QA, development, and product teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I lead QA initiatives focused on scaling automation with
            Playwright, API testing, and CI/CD optimization within cloud-based
            ecosystems. I have experience managing offshore teams, refining bug
            triage workflows, and introducing best practices that reduce test
            flakiness and improve deployment confidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond technical delivery, I care deeply about culture and
            leadership. I advocate for quiet leadership â€” emphasizing strategic
            thinking, mentorship, and empowerment over noise â€” and I'm the
            creator of the <em>UNMUTED Framework</em>, a tactical and
            philosophical guide for reclaiming your voice in undervalued
            environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hold certifications in Project Management and Software Quality,
            with additional training in full-stack development and API
            integrations. I'm continually learning, iterating, and pushing for
            better â€” for my teams, my work, and myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently open to networking with technology leaders, product
            managers, and organizations that value high standards, clear
            communication, and continuous improvement. Always excited to connect
            with those who are building the future â€” and want to do it the right
            way.
